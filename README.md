This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Farewill Test
Small coding test for Farewill, utilising data to display random quotes from Simpsons characters.

### Installation
If you wish to view this project, clone me down!

Run the following command.

`git clone https://github.com/OliverHeward/Farewill.git && cd Farewill``

Install dependencies.

```shell
npm install
```

Once the dependencies are installed, run start on the app.

```shell
npm start
```

If the app fails to start, check the log and see if there are any dependencies that were missed from `package-lock.json` before running `npm start` again.

If successful, you should see the application running on `http://localhost:3000/`
